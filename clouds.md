This project is an act of listening from a great height. It takes the slow, majestic transit of clouds over Costa Rica, captured by the GOES-16 satellite, and transforms it into generative musical architectures. It is not a literal translation, but a second conversation: where the wind that moves the clouds becomes the pulse that activates musical wind chimes, creating polyrhythms that reflect the density and geography of the cloud formations.

How it Works: A Sonic Observatory

The algorithm divides each satellite image into a grid, like a celestial score.

Each quadrant is assigned a simple rhythmic-melodic pattern (a repeated note, a minimal cell).

If the cloud density in that quadrant exceeds a threshold, its corresponding "wind chime" is activated.

The note's intensity fluctuates in a wave, swelling and fading like the very mass of a cloud.

The simultaneous overlay of dozens of these activated pulses generates complex, emergent polyrhythms, impossible to compose traditionally.

Sonic Result: The Sky in Ambient and Techno Keys

The main composition, "This silence Made me feel empty", belongs to the ambient genre. A cello and a synthetic pad establish a melancholic, static harmonic bed, upon which the piano—guided by the algorithm—draws a chaotic, ephemeral, and ever-changing melody, just like the clouds that originated it. The piece exists to be part of the environment, to be heard peripherally, like gazing at the sky.

To demonstrate the system's versatility as a compositional tool, a second piece was created: "I have Made it through this heavy storm". Here, the same flow of cloud data transforms into electric arpeggios and acid synthesizers, becoming the rhythmic and melodic engine of a techno track. The data storm becomes a sonic storm.

Conceptual Core: Legacy and Listening

This project does not seek only to produce music, but to create a sonic legacy of invisible phenomena. It treats the clouds as co-authors, acknowledging their dynamic and chaotic beauty. It is a practice situated on the frontier where a precise mathematical model (formalized in matrices and Hadamard products) dissolves to give way to the emotion, ambiguity, and quiet intensity of a musical piece.

The ultimate goal is simple and profound: that by listening to the polyrhythmic harmony generated by a cloudy day over a mountain range, someone might feel curious to look up and wonder about the science and poetry hidden in the seemingly ordinary.
